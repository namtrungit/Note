- Defer:
	+ Skip func util other func complete
	+ Deferred func calls are pushed onto stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are excuted in last-in-first-out order.

- Maps:
	+ Insert: m[key] elem
	+ Retrieve an element: elem = m[key]
	+ Delete: delete(m, key)
	+ Test that a key is present with a two-value assignment: elem, ok = m[key]
		if key is in m, ok is true. If not, ok is false

- Methods: Go does not have classes. However, we can define methods on types

- Pointer receiviers: https://tour.golang.org/methods/4

- Interfaces: An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures. A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.
